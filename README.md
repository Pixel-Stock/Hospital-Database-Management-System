# Hospital-Database-Management-System

Its mainly from the prespective that there is a clinic named Oakwell Medical, and the receptionist has to use this to organize appoinments and track patients.

It features a clean UI for everything, Login, Dashboard, Patient Management and Appoinment Management.

Its a very simple Database Management System, without actually using a database such as MYSQL or SQLite3, etc. It will create a simple .txt file stored locally on your device.
